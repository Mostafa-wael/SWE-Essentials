# What you should know as a software engineer?

## Introduction

Software engineering is a field that is constantly evolving. It is important to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in order to stay competitive. Nevertheless, there are a lot of basics that are crucial and common to all software engineers. This article may be more tuned towards web development but the concepts are applicable to all software engineers.

In this article, we will discuss some of the key concepts that every software engineer should know.

## Programming Language

You should be proficient in at least one programming language. This is the most basic requirement for any software engineer. You should be able to write clean, efficient code that is easy to read and maintain. You should learn the best practices of the language you are using and follow them. You should also be familiar with the common data structures and algorithms used in this language.

After mastering one language, you should be able to learn new languages quickly. This will help you adapt to new technologies and stay competitive in the job market.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

You should have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms. This is essential for writing efficient code. You should be able to choose the right data structure for the problem at hand and implement the algorithm that solves the problem in the most efficient way. You should be familiar with common algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

You should also be able to analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithms. This will help you understand the performance of your code and optimize it when needed. 

You need to learn data structures and relate them to your programming language i.e. you need to understand that the dictionary data structure in Python is a hash table, and the list is an array and so on.

Essential data structures include:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Core algorithms encompass:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking  
- Bit Manipulation
- String algorithms

## Object-Oriented Programming

You should have a good understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. This is essential for writing modular and maintainable code. You should be able to design classes and objects that model real-world entities.

You should be familiar with concepts like

- Abstraction: Concealing the intricate implementation details of a class while exposing only pertinent information to external entities.
- Encapsulation: Bundling the data and methods of a class into a cohesive unit, shielding internal complexities from external interference.
- Inheritance: Leveraging existing class code to construct new classes, facilitating code reuse and promoting hierarchy within the codebase.
- Polymorphism: Endowing objects with the ability to assume multiple forms, enabling dynamic behavior and enhancing code flexibility.

## Design Patterns

You should be familiar with common design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They help you write code that is more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.

Design patterns are divided into three categories:

  - Singleton
  - Factory
- Structural patterns: These patterns deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects.
  - Adapter
  - Facade
  - Proxy
- Behavioral patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
  - Observer
  - Strategy
  - Chain of Responsibility

## Clean Code

  - Open/Closed Principle: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the behavior of the program.
  - Interface Segregation Principle: A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.
  - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle: This principle states that you should not repeat the same code in multiple places in your codebase.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle: This principle states that you should keep your code simple and easy to understand.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle: This principle states that you should not add functionality to your codebase until you actually need it.
